This project was created as a Valentine's Day gift for my boyfriend. Since he is currently majoring in Computer Science, I wanted to design something that aligned with his interests. It was a fun and meaningful project, and I'm so happy with how it turned out!

As someone with limited coding experience, I relied heavily on the help of my friends and various YouTube tutorials. Their support was invaluable throughout the process.

Overall, it was a rewarding experience, and I'm proud of the final result. I hope this project serves as a great reminder of how much thought and love went into creating it!
